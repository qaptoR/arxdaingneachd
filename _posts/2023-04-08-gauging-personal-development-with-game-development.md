## The Problem

For anyone who has just started learning game development it can be daunting to think of all the things that one is yet to know.
And given the enormous size of what is not known it can be a frustrating prospect to measure how much one has achieved in
understanding relative to the greater whole.

## A Proposed Solution

One great way to eventually gauge your learning is to choose a simple tutorial for any game engine and start to following along.
Whenever they do something try to recreate it in your game engine of choice.
Given that my preferred engine is Godot (if you didn't already know), and that I have some experience already with Unity and Unreal,
those will be used in the examples moving forward.

I wouldn't recommend anyone start doing this until they've at least completed 2 or 3 beginner tutorials, or 1 intermediate tutorial
in Godot.
Once you've got some comprehension of the tools available though, it's a fantastic way of learning more advanced things.
It also opens up a whole new possibility for tutorials since the engine used for them becomes agnostic to the game design
techniques being presented in the content.

Don't be frustrated by what you don't know however, as it will initially be quite a lot: this ability to translate game-development
techniques between engines is intermediate level.
If you pick the right tutorial, though, it should start off slow enough that you can at least get through the initial stages
before you have to research documentation for Unity or Unreal, and Godot.

## Why It Works

Game development and, by association, programming are in this modern era less and less about the technical details of how x and y is
achieved in langauge p or q, or engine m or n.
The key thing to focus on learning in these fields are the broad strokes that interconnect the different facets of games and
systems.
The technical knowledge required to use a specific language or engine, then, will come from our focus on a particular project
where we learn the more intimate details necessary to accomplish a task with a given tool.

By focusing on building a game in Godot that follows a tutorial in Unity we can actually develop a deeper understanding of
both engines on a technical level even as our focus is on the techniques.
Therefore, the faster and more ready we are with solutions for translating some new behaviour or feature used in one engine
to our own, the better we can pinpoint exactly how far along we have come in our personal development.

Once we can look at any game feature `w`, or aspect of development `v` in any engine and can immediately ascertain how to
accomplish it in this engine or that language, then we can say with confidence that for `w` or `v` we are fluent in this or that.

## The Added Benefit

The big 3 engines (in my mind) Unreal, Unity, and Godot, all use a similar development paradigm, which is a scene/tree-like
structure with objects/nodes.
This makes them extrememly viable as choice engines for doing translations between, especially since they each target a specific
market sector.

Unity and Unreal are industry popular engines, and understanding how to translate between Godot and them means you have skills that
you can use in the job market.
Of course you need to think about your own personal goals and what makes sense for you and the time you have to commit to learning
game development.

In general this is how I decide which engine is best for me:

- For a small team or solo indie developer Godot is hands down the best option imo.
- For working `AAA`, focus on translating between Unreal and Godot.
- For working `AA/Indie`, focus on translating between Unity and Godot.

If you really only want to use Godot, then I would still suggest doing the translations but with a greater focus of your energy on
converting from them to Godot.
Only pay enough attention, though, to how they do things in the other engine to see the underlying principles that will be
transferable to Godot.
The same thing can be said for Unity, or Unreal, if those are your die-hard witha passion favorite engine, like mine is Godot.

## In Summary

While this message so far has been about game development in a few specific game enginess, and how we can measure our growth
as developers by learning to translate the techniques presented in tutorials or features for any game into our engine of choice,
we can also apply this sentiment to all other aspects of our lives.

Growth, in any facet has to do with the ability to interpret and adapt what is into something new. 
When we shift our effort away from stock memorization and practice by numbers and into the realm of translation,
then we become fluent in the practice of our fields.
