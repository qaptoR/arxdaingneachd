blog.arxdaingneachd.org is the public facing narrative expression of my collected knowledge.

In simpler terms, the way I to try collect knowledge is based on the practice of building a 'mind palace', for which I call
mine `Arx Daingneachd`.

Though, while there is no current 1:1 visual representation of the palace, this blog is nonetheless
a space there where I can receive guests and host a salon of sorts. It provides me a way to showcase particular wings, rooms,
furniture or objects, and especially books with their seemingly infinite pages.

I don't dare consider my palace massive or even large, and certainly would I in no way consider it complete, but after
many years of learning and integrating knowledge into a sprawling web of insight and intuition I have started to build
up from a strong foundation the walls and celings that make up the metaphysical presence of my mental structure.

Therefore, if whatever you happen to read here interests you, either in this post or another, I encourage you to continue to
participate by following along with my journey and participating in whatever ways are currently available.
